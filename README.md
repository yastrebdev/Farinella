## About project

I was approached by an acquaintance with a request to advise her friend from Canada on website design. I responded, and eventually the design evolved into a full-fledged frontend development using the react library.

The design was implemented in 10 days, including all the edits. The bulk of the development completed in 30 days.

## Difficult moments in the development process

1. I had to write my own carousel component to freely customize the sliders
2. Adding items to your cart is not difficult. But it's not easy to add ingredients separately for each item

## Stack

This is a project created using the `create-react-app`

> **Main stack:** `react`, `redux toolkit`, `typescript`

> **Additional technologies:** `react-router-dom`, `axios`

> The **mockAPI** service is used to host the data
